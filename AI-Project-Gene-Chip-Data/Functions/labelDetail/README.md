# SJTU Artificial Intelligence Project:A Classifier for gene chip data

The project trained some classifiers to classify the gene chip data into several kinds by machine learning methods and deep learning methods respectively, including Logistic Regression(LR), Support Vector Machine(SVM), and Deep Belief Network(DBN). A project report is attached. Original data is available at <a href = "http://pan.baidu.com/s/1mi9QDAw">here</a> with the code <b>5q32</b>.

PCA methods and deep learning methods is referred to <a href = "https://github.com/rozentill/GeneChip">GeneChip</a> and <a href = "https://github.com/xiaohu2015/DeepLearning_tutorials">DeepLearning_tutorials</a>.

----------

Functions:

- count.py: Count the numbers of the gene chips with certain features
- preview.py: Preview the beginning *n* lines of the dataset
- regular.py: Regularize the processed dataset so that all the data are distributed in [0,1]
- transpose.py: Transpose the Matrix
